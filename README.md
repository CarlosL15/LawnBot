#LawnBot 
A semi autonomous lawn mower with 3 modes Idle, Manual and Automatic. While in idle mode you can control the lawnmower with a blutooth controller such as 
a playstation controller and a xbox controller. In manual mode you can set the lawn mower in its starting point and control the lawn mower to go where you want 
it to go by itself. In Automatic mode the Lawnbot will follow the path from the manual mode and reverse that path to it's starting point.
